# SOPs & Policy Education

This folder contains standard operating procedures (SOPs) and policy education materials that support consistent execution, compliance, and audit readiness in a healthcare supply chain environment.

SOPs are written to be clear, teachable, and operationally realistic. Each procedure aligns with training content and system workflows to reduce variation and risk.

## What’s Inside
- Standard SOP template
- Example SOP for receiving discrepancies
- Policy-aligned procedures designed for education and compliance

## How this is applied
These SOPs are used as both training references and operational controls, ensuring staff understand not only *what* to do, but *why* it matters.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
If a procedure cannot be taught, followed, and audited, it is not effective. SOPs should support staff while protecting the organization.
