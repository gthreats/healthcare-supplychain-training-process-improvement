# SOP: Receiving Discrepancies (Healthcare Supply Chain)

## Purpose
Ensure accurate and timely resolution of receiving discrepancies to maintain inventory integrity, financial accuracy, and vendor accountability.

## Scope
Applies to all Supply Chain receiving staff handling inbound deliveries.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- Receiver: Identify and document discrepancies
- Inventory Control: Review and adjust inventory records
- Procurement: Coordinate vendor resolution if required
- Accounts Payable: Resolve invoice impacts

## Procedure Steps
1. Verify shipment against PO and packing slip
2. Identify discrepancy type (shortage, overage, damage)
3. Document discrepancy in receiving system
4. Notify appropriate stakeholders based on discrepancy type
5. Initiate vendor communication if required
6. Confirm resolution and update records

## Controls & Compliance
- Receiving documentation retained for audit
- System adjustments require appropriate authorization
- Separation between receiving and financial posting

## Common Errors & Prevention
- Failure to document discrepancies promptly
- Incorrect quantity adjustments
- Delayed communication to Procurement or AP

## Escalation Path
Escalate unresolved discrepancies after defined thresholds to Inventory Control leadership.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
This SOP reduces downstream financial errors and audit risk by standardizing how discrepancies are handled and documented.
