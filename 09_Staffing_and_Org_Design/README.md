# Staffing and Organizational Design

> Purpose: Define how the Supply Chain Enablement & Process Improvement function is designed, staffed, and scaled in a fiscally responsible and outcome-driven manner.

---

This folder documents the **staffing logic, role design, and hiring sequence** used to stand up a Supply Chain Enablement & Process Improvement department from zero headcount.

The approach prioritizes:
- Delivering value before scaling
- Staffing based on capabilities, not titles
- Protecting operational SMEs from burnout
- Aligning headcount growth to proven demand and outcomes

This model is designed for complex, multi-site healthcare supply chain environments where training, process standardization, and system adoption must scale without creating dependency on tribal knowledge.
