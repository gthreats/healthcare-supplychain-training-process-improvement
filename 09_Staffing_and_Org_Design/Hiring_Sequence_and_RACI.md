# Hiring Sequence and RACI

> **Purpose:** Explain how hiring is sequenced to unlock execution while maintaining accountability and minimizing SME burden.

## Hiring Sequence Logic

Hiring follows **execution dependency**, not hierarchy.

### Sequence
1. **Manager / Lead** – establishes direction, governance, and prioritization  
2. **Instructional Design / Content** – unlocks scalable training delivery  
3. **Process Improvement / Adoption** – embeds change into operations  
4. **Coordinator / Analyst** – increases throughput and visibility  

Each hire is intended to immediately multiply impact rather than add overhead.

## High-Level RACI Example

| Activity | Manager | ID Lead | PI Specialist | Ops SME |
|--------|--------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Training Strategy | R | A | C | I |
| Content Creation | C | R | C | I |
| Standard Work | A | C | R | C |
| Training Delivery | A | R | C | I |
| Approval | A | C | C | R |

**Key Principle:**  
Operational SMEs approve and validate content — they are not the delivery engine.

## Why This Matters
- Protects SMEs from constant ad hoc requests  
- Creates clear ownership  
- Enables scalable execution

## My thought process on this as a Manager

Sequencing hires this way ensures the department can deliver value immediately without waiting for full staffing. It also prevents dependency on heroics and keeps accountability clear as the team grows.
