# Staffing Model – Year 1 and Year 2

> **Purpose:** Explain how staffing decisions are derived from outcomes, workload, and fiscal constraints rather than headcount assumptions.

---

## Staffing Philosophy

Staffing is designed around **capabilities required to deliver outcomes**, not static job titles.  
The model begins with a **Minimum Viable Team (MVT)** that can execute core responsibilities, prove value, and establish governance before scaling.

Headcount increases only when:
- Demand is repeatable and measurable
- Value has been demonstrated
- Additional capacity directly improves operational outcomes

## Year 1: Minimum Viable Team (Foundation Year)

### Objective
Stand up the function, deliver early operational wins, and establish standard methods for training, process improvement, and change adoption.

### Characteristics
- Player-coach leadership model  
- Broad skill coverage  
- Heavy use of templates, standard work, and reusable assets  
- Focus on high-impact workflows  

### Core Roles

**Supply Chain Enablement Manager (1 FTE)**  
Owns charter, roadmap, prioritization, and stakeholder alignment. Acts as both leader and execution anchor.

**Instructional Design / Content Lead (1 FTE)**  
Builds onboarding, role-based learning, and job aids that convert SME knowledge into scalable assets.

**Process Improvement & Adoption Specialist (1 FTE)**  
Documents standard work and partners with operations to embed improvements.

**Program Coordinator / Analyst (0.5–1 FTE)**  
Manages intake, scheduling, reporting, and content administration.

> Year 1 prioritizes depth over breadth: fewer initiatives executed well.

## Year 2: Scaled Enablement Model

### Objective
Expand coverage, increase specialization, and support enterprise-wide consistency.

### Expanded Capabilities
- Dedicated analytics and KPI ownership  
- Site or regional training coverage  
- Systems adoption specialization  
- Increased content throughput  

### Scaling Principle
Headcount is added only where demand and ROI are proven through Year 1 performance metrics.

## Why This Model Works
- Prevents over-hiring before value is demonstrated  
- Enables leadership to see ROI clearly  
- Reduces dependency on SMEs  
- Scales sustainably across sites and roles

## My thought process on this as a Manager

I treat staffing as a system design problem, not a headcount exercise. By defining outcomes first and sequencing hires based on execution dependency, I can deliver value early, justify growth with data, and protect operational partners from burnout.
