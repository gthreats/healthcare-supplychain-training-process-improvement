# Supply Chain Enablement Program Charter (Healthcare)

## Purpose
Establish a repeatable education and process improvement program that improves operational readiness, standardizes best practices, and supports system adoption across Supply Chain and institutional stakeholders.

## Problem Statement
In healthcare supply chain, performance gaps commonly stem from inconsistent training, unclear ownership of processes, and uneven adoption of system functionality, creating rework, delays, and compliance risk.

## Goals
- Reduce time-to-proficiency for new hires through role-based onboarding
- Standardize training and SOPs across teams and sites
- Improve adoption of eProcurement and related system enhancements
- Reduce error rates, rework, and ticket volume through effective readiness and hypercare
- Provide leadership reporting tied to measurable outcomes

## Scope
Included:
- New hire onboarding (30-60-90 enablement)
- Cross-functional training (Procurement, Receiving, AP handoffs, IR adoption)
- SOP/policy education materials and updates
- Change readiness for system enhancements
- KPI definition and performance reporting

Out of Scope (initially):
- Vendor-managed training owned by external partners (unless integrated into onboarding)
- Deep technical build documentation intended for developers (IR maintains)

## Key Stakeholders
- Supply Chain Leadership (Sponsors)
- Procurement / Contracting
- Receiving / Distribution / Inventory teams
- Accounts Payable / Finance partners
- Information Resources (IR) / systems support
- End-user departments (clinical and non-clinical requesters)

## Operating Model
- Central intake for training and improvement requests
- Monthly enablement forum to prioritize, align, and approve deliverables
- Standard templates for modules, SOPs, and readiness plans
- Continuous feedback loop through KPIs and frontline input

## Success Measures (examples)
- Training completion rate by role and site
- Time-to-proficiency (30/60/90 readiness checks)
- Requisition/receiving error rate trend
- Ticket volume trend after go-live
- Cycle time improvements for key workflows

# Practical Application in an Academic Medical Center

In an academic medical center environment, this program would function as a centralized framework for supply chain education, system adoption, and process improvement. Role-based onboarding and readiness paths would establish consistent time-to-proficiency for new staff, while cross-functional training would support smoother handoffs between Supply Chain, Information Resources, Finance, and end-user departments.

During system enhancements or workflow changes, the program would serve as the change enablement layer, supporting user readiness, communication, and adoption rather than relying on post-go-live support alone. Training effectiveness and system adoption would be monitored through defined KPIs, allowing leadership to connect education efforts to measurable operational outcomes such as error reduction, cycle time improvements, and reduced rework.

This approach allows education to scale alongside operational complexity while maintaining standardized practices, compliance, and continuous improvement.
