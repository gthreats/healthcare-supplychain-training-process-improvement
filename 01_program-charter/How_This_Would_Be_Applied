# Application of the Supply Chain Enablement Program at UT Southwestern

---

## Overview

This document describes how the Supply Chain Enablement Program would be applied within an academic medical center environment such as UT Southwestern.

The framework is designed to support standardized education, system adoption, and continuous process improvement across a complex, cross-functional healthcare supply chain. Education and training are positioned as strategic capabilities that support operational readiness, compliance, and measurable performance outcomes.

## Role-Based Onboarding and Readiness

The program supports new Supply Chain staff through structured, role-based onboarding using 30-60-90 day readiness paths.

These learning paths are designed to reduce time-to-proficiency by standardizing:

- Foundational supply chain knowledge  
- System usage and transaction accuracy  
- Policy awareness and compliance expectations  
- Workflow ownership across procurement, receiving, inventory, and accounts payable  

This approach reduces onboarding variability, reinforces compliance from day one, and ensures consistent operational readiness across teams and sites.

## Cross-Functional Training and Knowledge Continuity

Beyond onboarding, the program enables cross-functional training focused on key handoff points between Supply Chain, Information Resources (IR), Finance, and end-user departments.

Training modules and reference materials address common breakdown areas such as:

- eProcurement request-to-receipt workflows  
- Receiving discrepancies and inventory adjustments  
- Accounts Payable handoffs and issue resolution  
- IR-supported system workflows impacting Supply Chain operations  

By improving shared understanding across functions, the program helps reduce rework, delays, and downstream errors that frequently occur in healthcare supply chains.
