# Program Charter

This folder establishes governance for a Supply Chain Education & Process Improvement program in a complex healthcare environment. The goal is to prevent ad hoc training, inconsistent SOPs, and fragmented system adoption by defining ownership, intake, cadence, and success measures.

## What’s Inside
- **Enablement Program Charter:** purpose, scope, stakeholders, and operating model
- **RACI & Cadence:** roles/responsibilities and recurring forums (monthly readiness and standard work)

## How this is applied
These documents are used to align Supply Chain, IR, Finance, and operational leaders on priorities, training standards, and change-management expectations before launching new training or system functionality.

## How I speak to this in an interview
“I start with governance so training scales. This shows how I align leaders, define ownership, and ensure education supports operational control and measurable outcomes.”
