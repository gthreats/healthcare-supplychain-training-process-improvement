# Cross-Functional Training

This folder contains training designed to improve coordination and reduce errors across Supply Chain, Information Resources (IR), Finance, and operational stakeholders.

The focus is not deep specialization, but shared understanding of workflows, handoffs, and downstream impacts, especially in system-enabled processes.

## What’s Inside
- End-to-end eProcurement training module
- Facilitator guidance for leading cross-functional forums
- Discussion formats tied to real operational scenarios

## How this is applied
These modules are delivered during onboarding, system changes, and monthly enablement forums to align teams on how their work affects others.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
Most operational issues occur at handoffs. Cross-functional training creates a shared mental model so teams anticipate downstream impact instead of reacting to problems.
