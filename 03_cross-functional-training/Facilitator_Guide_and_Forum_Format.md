# Facilitator Guide & Cross-Functional Forum Format

## Purpose
Provide a repeatable structure for leading effective cross-functional training and discussion forums.

## Facilitator Role
- Guide discussion, not lecture
- Translate technical detail into operational impact
- Encourage shared ownership instead of blame

## Forum Format (60 minutes)
1. Overview of topic and objective
2. End-to-end workflow walkthrough
3. Real-world issue or case study
4. Group discussion on prevention and improvement
5. Summary of actions and ownership

## Application
This format is used for:
- Monthly enablement forums
- System change readiness sessions
- Post-incident learning reviews

## My thought process on this as a Manager
I use facilitated forums to build alignment and trust across teams while turning problems into learning opportunities.
