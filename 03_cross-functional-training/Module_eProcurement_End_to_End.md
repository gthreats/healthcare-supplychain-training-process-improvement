# Cross-Functional Training Module: eProcurement End-to-End

## Purpose
Provide a shared understanding of the eProcurement lifecycle from requisition through payment, highlighting handoffs, controls, and common failure points.

## Audience
- Supply Chain staff
- IR system support
- Finance / Accounts Payable
- Departmental requesters (non-Supply Chain)

## Learning Objectives
Participants will be able to:
- Describe each stage of the eProcurement process
- Identify upstream and downstream dependencies
- Recognize common errors and escalation paths
- Understand compliance and approval controls

## Module Outline (60 minutes)
1. Requisition creation and approval logic
2. Contract vs non-contract purchasing
3. PO transmission and vendor interaction
4. Receiving and three-way match
5. Payment and exception resolution

## Common Failure Points
- Incorrect item selection or pricing
- Missing receipts or mismatched quantities
- Incomplete approvals delaying fulfillment
- Lack of understanding of escalation ownership

## Applied Scenario
Participants walk through a delayed order and identify where breakdowns occurred and how cross-functional awareness could have prevented them.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
I design training around real failure points so teams see how small upstream mistakes create downstream delays and rework.
