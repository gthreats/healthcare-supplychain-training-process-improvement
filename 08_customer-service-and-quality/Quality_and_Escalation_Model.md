# Quality and Escalation Model

## Purpose
Provide a structured approach for managing issues that affect service quality, compliance, or operational continuity.

## Issue Categories
- Routine service requests
- Operational disruptions
- Compliance or audit concerns
- Patient-care–impacting issues

## Escalation Framework
- Level 1: Frontline resolution using SOPs and job aids
- Level 2: Supervisor review and coordination
- Level 3: Leadership involvement and cross-functional escalation

## Continuous Learning
- Capture recurring issues
- Feed insights into training and SOP updates
- Review trends during enablement forums

## My thought process on this as a Manager
Escalation should be predictable and constructive, turning issues into learning instead of frustration.
