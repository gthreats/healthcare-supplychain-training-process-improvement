# Service Standards and SLAs (Healthcare Supply Chain)

## Purpose
Set clear expectations for response time, communication, and service quality when supporting internal customers.

## Core Service Principles
- Accuracy before speed
- Clear and timely communication
- Ownership through resolution
- Respect for clinical and operational urgency

## Example Service Standards
- Requisition inquiries acknowledged within 1 business day
- Receiving issues escalated same day when impacting patient care
- System-related issues routed through defined support channels

## Measurement
- Response time tracking
- Issue resolution time
- Customer feedback trends

## Application
Standards are reinforced through onboarding, training, and performance discussions.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
Clear service expectations protect staff from burnout while ensuring customers know what to expect.
