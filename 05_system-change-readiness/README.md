# System Change Readiness

This folder contains tools used to support successful adoption of supply chain system enhancements in partnership with Information Resources (IR).

The focus is on user readiness, communication, and operational stability, not just technical deployment. Training and readiness activities are aligned to reduce disruption, errors, and post, go-live support volume.

## What’s Inside
- Change impact assessment template
- Go-live readiness checklist
- Train-the-trainer framework

## How this is applied
These tools are used for system enhancements, integrations, and workflow changes affecting Supply Chain and end users.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
A system is not live when it is deployed, it is live when users can perform their work accurately and confidently.
