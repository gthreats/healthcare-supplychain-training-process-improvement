# Change Impact Assessment (Supply Chain Systems)

## Purpose
Identify who is impacted by a system change, how workflows will change, and what readiness activities are required before go-live.

## Change Overview
- Description of system enhancement or integration
- Target go-live date
- Systems impacted

## Impacted Stakeholders
- Supply Chain roles
- IR support teams
- Finance / AP
- End-user departments

## Workflow Impact
- New steps introduced
- Steps removed or modified
- Approval or control changes

## Risk Assessment
- Operational risk if change is misunderstood
- Compliance or audit implications
- Volume or timing sensitivity

## Required Readiness Actions
- Training modules required
- Job aids or SOP updates
- Communication plan
- Hypercare support needs

## My thought process on this as a Manager
I use impact assessments to prevent surprises and ensure training and communication are proportional to the risk of the change.
