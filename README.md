# Healthcare Supply Chain Training & Process Improvement

This repository demonstrates a structured, healthcare-focused approach to supply chain education, cross-functional training, SOP development, system change readiness, and continuous process improvement.

It is designed to show how supply chain enablement can be governed, scaled, and measured in complex, security-sensitive healthcare environments. The materials reflect real-world practices used to improve onboarding, system adoption, compliance, service quality, and operational performance.

## How to Navigate This Repository
The folders are organized to mirror how a healthcare supply chain enablement program operates:

1. **Program Charter** – Governance, ownership, and cadence  
2. **Onboarding Academy** – 30-60-90 day enablement and readiness  
3. **Cross-Functional Training** – End-to-end process alignment  
4. **SOPs & Policies** – Teachable, auditable standard work  
5. **System Change Readiness** – IR partnership and go-live adoption  
6. **Process Improvement** – A3 problem-solving and standardization  
7. **Data & KPIs** – Measuring training and operational outcomes  
8. **Customer Service & Quality** – Service standards and escalation  

## Purpose
This repository was created to demonstrate how supply chain education, process improvement, and system adoption can be integrated into a single, leadership-ready framework that supports operational readiness, compliance, and continuous improvement.
