# Intake and Prioritization Framework

> **Purpose:** Ensure work is selected based on impact, risk, and readiness rather than urgency or volume.

---

## Intake Principles
- All requests flow through a single intake mechanism
- No work begins without prioritization
- Visibility is more important than speed

---

## Prioritization Criteria (Illustrative)

| Criteria | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Operational Impact | Volume, cost, safety, or compliance exposure |
| Frequency | How often the issue occurs |
| Risk | Regulatory, audit, or patient care impact |
| Readiness | Availability of inputs and stakeholders |
| Reusability | Ability to scale across sites or roles |

Requests are scored and reviewed on a regular cadence to ensure focus remains on the highest-value work.

## Outcome
This framework prevents reactive work, protects limited capacity, and ensures leadership alignment on priorities.
