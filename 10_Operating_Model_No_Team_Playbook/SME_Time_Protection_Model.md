# SME Time Protection Model

> **Purpose:** Capture critical knowledge while minimizing disruption to operational subject matter experts.

---

## Core Principles
- Capture once, reuse many times
- SMEs validate content; they do not own delivery
- Engagements are short, structured, and intentional

---

## Engagement Model
- Time-boxed interviews (30 minutes or less)
- Workflow observation instead of repeated explanation
- Structured validation reviews instead of live training
- Clear start and end dates for SME involvement

---

## Benefits
- Reduced SME fatigue
- Faster content creation
- More consistent outputs
- Improved operational trust

---

## My thought process on this as a Manager

SMEs are a scarce and valuable resource. By designing around validation rather than dependency, I protect operations while still capturing the expertise needed to scale knowledge across the organization.
