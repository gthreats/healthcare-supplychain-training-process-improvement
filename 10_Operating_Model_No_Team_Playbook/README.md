This folder documents the **operating model used to execute work when formal headcount is limited or still being built**. The model is designed to ensure forward momentum, early wins, and credibility with stakeholders **without over-reliance on subject matter experts**.

The focus is on:
- Immediate execution without waiting for perfect conditions
- Structured intake and prioritization
- Time-boxed SME engagement
- Reusable, scalable deliverables
- Measurable progress tied to operational outcomes

This approach allows the organization to see value early while laying the foundation for sustainable scale.
