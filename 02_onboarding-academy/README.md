# Onboarding Academy

This folder contains standardized onboarding and enablement materials designed to reduce time-to-proficiency for new Supply Chain team members in a healthcare environment.

The onboarding academy focuses on role clarity, system understanding, compliance awareness, and operational readiness. Training is structured, progressive, and measurable to ensure consistency across teams and sites.

## What’s Inside
- 30-60-90 day enablement framework
- Role-based learning paths for Supply Chain functions
- Competency and readiness checklists tied to operational outcomes

## How this is applied
These materials are used by managers and trainers to onboard new hires consistently, identify early skill gaps, and ensure new team members can safely and effectively perform in a security-sensitive healthcare setting.

## How I speak to this in an interview
“This is how I shorten ramp time and reduce errors. Instead of vague onboarding, I define what proficiency looks like at 30, 60, and 90 days and hold the process accountable.”
