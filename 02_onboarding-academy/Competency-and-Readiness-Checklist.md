# Competency and Readiness Checklist

## Purpose
Provide a clear, measurable method to validate readiness at 30, 60, and 90 days.

## Core Competencies
- System navigation and basic transactions
- SOP adherence and documentation accuracy
- Understanding of escalation paths
- Compliance and data security awareness
- Customer service and communication standards

## Readiness Validation
- Manager observation and sign-off
- Review of error trends and rework
- Completion of required training modules
- Scenario-based discussion or demonstration

## Outcome
This checklist ensures onboarding decisions are based on evidence—not time served.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
“This is how I take subjectivity out of onboarding and protect operational quality.”
