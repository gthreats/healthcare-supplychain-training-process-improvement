# Example A3: Receiving Cycle Time Reduction

## Problem Statement
Receiving cycle time exceeds targets, causing delayed inventory availability and downstream fulfillment issues.

## Current State
- Inconsistent documentation at receipt
- Delays in discrepancy resolution
- Limited visibility to backlog during peak hours

## Target State
- Reduce average receiving cycle time by 20%
- Improve same-day inventory availability for critical items

## Root Cause Analysis
- Lack of standardized work during peak deliveries
- Unclear escalation for discrepancies
- Limited cross-training across shifts

## Countermeasures
- Implement standard receiving checklist
- Define escalation timing for discrepancies
- Cross-train staff on high-volume processes

## Implementation Plan
- Update SOP and job aids
- Train receiving staff
- Monitor cycle time weekly

## Results
Cycle time reduced; fewer delayed receipts reported.

## Standardization
Update SOPs and onboarding materials to reflect new standard work.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
I focus on improvements that reduce friction for both frontline staff and downstream partners.
