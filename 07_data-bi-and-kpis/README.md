# Data, BI, and KPIs

This folder defines how training, system readiness, and process improvement are measured and reported to leadership.

The intent is to link education efforts to operational performance, adoption, and risk reduction rather than relying on completion metrics alone.

## What’s Inside
- KPI dictionary with clear definitions
- Training and adoption metrics tied to outcomes
- Measurement framework supporting continuous improvement

## How this is applied
These metrics are reviewed in enablement forums and leadership updates to guide prioritization and improvement decisions.

## My thought process on this as a Manager
If training and process improvement cannot be measured, they cannot be improved or defended as a business investment.
