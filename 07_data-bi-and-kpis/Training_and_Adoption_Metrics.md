# Training and Adoption Metrics Framework

## Purpose
Describe how education and readiness efforts translate into operational results.

## Measurement Approach
Training metrics are paired with operational KPIs to evaluate impact rather than activity.

## Examples
- Training completion paired with requisition error trends
- New hire onboarding paired with time-to-proficiency
- System training paired with post–go-live ticket volume

## Review Cadence
- Weekly: operational trend monitoring during go-live or improvement initiatives
- Monthly: enablement forum review
- Quarterly: leadership summary

## Application
Metrics inform:
- Additional training needs
- SOP updates
- Process improvement prioritization
- Leadership decision-making

## My thought process on this as a Manager
I use data to focus conversations on outcomes, not opinions, and to continuously refine training and processes.
